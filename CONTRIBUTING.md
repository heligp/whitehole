# Contributing to Whitehole
<br />

In Quantmoon Technologies, as a way to fill the gap between the financial industry and individuals initiatives, we want to share some tools that we believe could be useful for quantitative research for investments. For this purpose, we will be releasing new versions of the Whitehole package with new features added.

But also we know that there are (and will be) many aspects that can be improved. That's why we ask you to report issues as much as detailed to make the improvements or fix the bugs when needed.

Also if you believe that there are new features that could or should be added, or for some other concerns, please feel free to writing us to: contacto@quantmoon.com, we want to know about Whitehole users as a part of a quantitative community.

We are convinced that many heads think better than 3 (as the number of members of Quantmoon Technologies at the moment of this released).

We hope to enable contributions by pull requests soon, we are still developing the respective guidelines to that.
